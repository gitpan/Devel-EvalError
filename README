Devel::EvalError -- Reliably detect if and why eval() failed

See EvalError.pm for full (POD) documentation.

Using Devel::EvalError encourages you to use more reliable ways to check
whether eval() failed while also giving you access to the failure reason(s)
even if $@ ended up empty.  (It also makes $@ ending up empty less likely
for other uses of eval().)  Although it is common to check C<$@> to determine
if a call to C<eval> failed, it is easy to make C<eval> fail while leaving
C<$@> empty.
